\# Portfolio Project: Overall Performance Analysis



\## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates my data analysis skills using Python and Jupyter Notebook.  

It focuses on \*\*analyzing adoption trends\*\* , understanding different counties capabilities when it comes to purchasing power and the brand of preference. It also goes ahead to analyze each trainer in depth, their loan background to purchase products and their repayment model. We also have an executive dashboard that can help both stakeholders and business owners understand their performances during different periods, and generating actionable insights.

\## 🎯 Objective

\- Understand :

1. How different counties perform in the market.
2. How different individuals are able to control their counties performance.
3. The different threats to livestock using the different services offered.
4. How decisions are made using historical data from different time periods.
5. How the Quality Assurance personnel works on ensuring quality data. 

\- Identify key trends and patterns  

\- Provide actionable recommendations based on data insights

\## 📊 Analysis \& Insights

1\. \*\*Data Cleaning \& Preprocessing\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Removed duplicates  

&nbsp;  - Handled missing values  

&nbsp;  - Standardized column formats  



2\. \*\*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Identified trends per \[category/brand/trainer/etc.]  

&nbsp;  - Visualized distributions, adoption rates, and patterns  



3\. \*\*Key Insights\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Goats were the highest recipients of livestock services  

&nbsp;  - Vaccination was the most common livestock service across all categories  

&nbsp;  - Seasonal patterns can be observed in farmer frequency purchases  

&nbsp;  - Training interventions increased adoption by 75% (where applicable)  



4\. \*\*Recommendations\*\*

\- Focus resources on goat vaccination programs to maximize adoption.

\- Continue targeted training interventions to improve overall livestock service uptake.

\- Expand vaccination campaigns to other livestock categories with lower service uptake.

\- Schedule seasonal programs to align with observed farmer purchasing patterns.

\- Provide farmer education on the benefits of livestock services to increase participation.

\- Monitor adoption trends regularly to adjust training and service deployment strategies.

\- Explore incentives for farmers who adopt services consistently to encourage sustained engagement.
